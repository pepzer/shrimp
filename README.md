## What is Shrimp?

Shrimp is a [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org/) library that implements asynchronous communication channels, built on top of [Red Lobster](https://github.com/whamtet/redlobster) promise library.  
It targets [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Lumo](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo) with the aim to be lightweight and to offer in addition useful functionalities for testing async functions.  
This is an experiment and there is no plan to offer more functionalities and no attempt to hide the underlying promise API.  
To work with [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) on Lumo check [Andare](https://github.com/mfikes/andare). 

Almost all operations on channels in Shrimp return a Red Lobster promise that could be managed with functions and macros from the same library.  
In addition Shrimp offers an async supporting loop macro, and there is also [Shrimp-Chain](https://github.com/pepzer/shrimp-chain), a collection of macros built on top of Shrimp providing a unified way to manage multiple async operations returning promises intertwined with synchronous ones.

## Leiningen/Clojars/Lumo

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/shrimp.svg)](https://clojars.org/shrimp)

If you use [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) add redlobster and shrimp to the dependencies in your project.clj file.

```clojure
:dependencies [... 
               [org.clojars.pepzer/redlobster "0.2.2"]
               [shrimp "0.1.0"]]
```
    
For Lumo you could either download the dependencies with Leiningen/Maven and specify the libraries on the CLI this way:

    $ lumo -D org.clojars.pepzer/redlobster:0.2.2,shrimp:0.1.0
    
Or you could download the jar files and add them to Lumo classpath:

    $ lumo -c redlobster-0.2.2.jar:shrimp-0.1.0.jar 
    
## Note on Red Lobster

The release of Red Lobster listed above is my version, the reason is a small fix that avoids annoying (especially with Lumo) warnings on compilation.  
I will send a pull request with this fix and if the official release gets updated i will switch to that as a dependency.

## REPL

To run a REPL in the project directory you could either use lein figwheel (optionally with rlwrap):
   
    $ rlwrap lein figwheel dev

With Node.js and npm installed open a shell, navigate to the root of the project and run:

    $ npm install ws
    $ node target/out/shrimp.js

Then the REPL should connect in the lein figwheel window.

With Lumo installed just run the lumo-repl.cljsh script:
   
    $ bash lumo-repl.cljsh
    
This will run the REPL and will also listen on the port 12345 of the localhost for connections.  
You could connect with Emacs and inf-clojure-connect.

## Usage

To use shrimp, require the shrimp.core namespace, and create a channnel:
 
```clojure
(require '[shrimp.core :as sc])

(def chan1 (sc/chan))
```
    
To close a channel:

```clojure
(sc/close! chan1)
```

A closed channel allows to take! until the values-queue is empty, then it switches to dead, to test the channel state:

```clojure
(sc/closed? chan1)

(sc/dead? chan1)
```

A channel has a buffer-size that defines the maximum dimension of the queue for both put! and take! operations.  
After the number of puts or takes reaches the buffer-size, a new call will fail (i.e. return a promise already realised to respectively false and nil for put! and take!/alts!).  
The default limit for the buffer is 1024, a different value could be specified on creation:

```clojure
(def chan2 (sc/chan 20))
```

### put! and take!

Require Red Lobster macros with use-macros to manage the channel promises:

```clojure
(require '[shrimp.core :as sc])
(use-macros '[redlobster.macros :only [let-realised]])

                                        ; Define the channel
(def chan1 (sc/chan))

                                        ; Try to take from the channel
                                        ; Print the value when the promise is realised
(let-realised [prom (sc/take! chan1)]
  (do (println "Val: " @prom)
      (sc/close! chan1)))

                                        ; Put a value inside the channnel
(sc/put! chan1 "foo")

=> Val: foo
```

### alts!

There is an alts! function to take from the first available channel with an optional timeout and corresponding default value:

```clojure
(require '[shrimp.core :as sc])
(use-macros '[redlobster.macros :only [let-realised]])

                                        ; Define the channels
(def chan1 (sc/chan))
(def chan2 (sc/chan))

                                        ; Try to take from both channels
                                        ; Print the value when the promise is realised
(let-realised [prom (sc/alts! [chan1 chan2])]
  (let [[v ch] @prom] 
    (if (= ch chan1)
      (println "Val: " v ", from chan1")
      (println "Val: " v ", from chan2"))
    (sc/close! chan1)))

                                        ; Put a value inside the channnel
(sc/put! chan1 "foo")

=> Val: foo , from chan1
```

To define a timeout of 1 second and a default value on expiration:

```clojure
(ps/alts! [chan1 chan2] 1000 "default value")
```

### defer-loop

This macro mimics Clojure's loop, but it allows to use asynchronous functions inside the loop:

```clojure
(require '[shrimp.core :as sc])
(use-macros '[redlobster.macros :only [when-realised]])
(use-macros '[shrimp.macros :only [defer-loop]])

                                        ; Define the channel
(def chan1 (sc/chan))

                                        ; The loop stops when the take! promise realises to nil
(defer-loop [prom (sc/take! chan1)]
  (when-realised [prom]
    (if @prom
      (do
        (println "Val: " @prom ", from defer-loop")

                                        ; defer-recur works like recur
                                        ; It is only defined under the scope of the defer-loop macro
        (defer-recur (sc/take! chan1)))

      (println "Exit from the loop"))))

                                        ; Put a value inside the channnel
(sc/put! chan1 "foo")

(sc/close! chan1)

=> Val: foo , from defer-loop
Exit from the loop
```


## Extras and Testing

There are other macros in shrimp that might be useful in particular for testing.

### defer

This is a slight variation on the Red Lobster's defer macro, it allows to defer the execution of an expression with a delay.  
Compared to Red Lobster, this version always requires the integer value for the delay, but now it could be a var in addition to a literal number, also if the delay is any negative value defer will use js/setImmediate.

```clojure
(use-macros '[shrimp.macros :only [defer]])

(defer 2000 (println "foo"))

=> foo
```

### defer-time

This small macro allows to easily print the elapsed time for an asynchronous function. The function do-time is defined inside the scope of the macro, it should be called as the last expression in the asynchronous block (or as a wrapper for it):

```clojure
(use-macros '[shrimp.macros :only [defer-time defer]])

(defer-time 
  (defer 2000 (do (println "foo")
                  (do-time (println "bar")))))

=> foo
bar
"Elapsed time: 2003.601113 msecs"
```

### Testing asynchronous functions

Shrimp provides a macro and the necessary helper functions to run asynchronous tests and receive correct error reports. The differences compared to standard tests are minimal.  
First create a test namespace to run all the other tests with the run-async-tests macro:

```clojure
(ns foo.all-tests
  (:require [foo.core-test]
            [foo.bar-test])
  (:use-macros [shrimp.test.macros :only [run-async-tests]]))

(defn -main []
  (run-async-tests
   foo.core-test
   foo.bar-test))
```

The only addition to the tests is a call to the done! function at the end of each deftest, a call to done! is required for *ALL* tests even for synchronous ones:

```clojure
(ns foo.core-test
  (:require [cljs.test :refer [deftest is]]
            [shrimp.test :as st])
  (:use-macros [shrimp.macros :only [defer]]))

(deftest sync-test
  (is (= 3 (+ 1 2)))
  (st/done!))

                                        ; Call st/done! as the last expression in the async block
(deftest async-test
  (defer 2000 (do
                (is (= 1 1))
                (st/done!))))
```

To run the tests invoke the main of foo.all-tests, for example with Lumo:

	$ lumo -c ... -m foo.all-tests

The output should be similar to this:

```
Testing foo.core-test

Ran 2 tests containing 2 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.

Testing foo.bar-test

Ran 2 tests containing 2 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.

All namespaces:

Ran 4 tests containing 4 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

## Tests

To run the tests with Leiningen use:

```
$ lein cljsbuild once
$ node target/out-test/shrimp.js
```

With Lumo:

```
$ bash lumo-test.sh
```

## Code Maturity

This is an early release, hence bugs should be expected and future releases could break the current API.
